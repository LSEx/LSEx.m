##   Matlab based Lindenmayer system Explorer

This GUI based toolbox is designed to either generate new or modify existing Lindenmayer systems/grammars. 



Lindenmayer System Generator:
    Using the Generator you can generate predefined Lindenmayer systems 
    (e.g. Fibonacci) or you can define your own rules to create grammars. 

Lindenmayer System Modifier:
    Using the Modifier you can change and modify existing L-systems, by 
    building rules to iteratively replace chains of n characters of the 
    system with chains of m other ones. 
    
See detailed description about the usage and the parameters that can be 
specified in the User Manual, by using the help buttons or by using the
"help" or "doc" function in Matlab.
